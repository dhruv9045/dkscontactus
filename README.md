The most common functionality added in any commercial app is the Developer's contact details!!
So this package helps the developers to simply add their details.

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

#Developers can add following details:
Company Name
Phone Number
Website
Email ID

Best feature is that, when the user clicks on any detail, respective app/web page will be opened.
